        <h3 id="headline">Why you must have Tesla Model 3</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Zero emissions </strong> - Before getting to other reasons,
            I’ll just note that buying a zero-emissions vehicle seems like an
            absolute requirement to me these days. Human society depends on it.
            Nonetheless, even if there was no such thing as climate change or
            air pollution, this top 10 list would still apply, so this is item
            #0 instead of item #1.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Safest car on the planet</strong> - This is a big one if
            you have kids, love your family and friends, and love yourself. This
            is one of my top 4 reasons for buying the Model 3, and it currently
            sits at #1. There are many reasons why the Model 3 is so safe in the
            event of an accident. Additionally, though, the car is extremely
            good at helping you avoid accidents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The driving quality</strong> - There’s really nothing that
            compares. Between the quick acceleration, the great handling, and
            the smooth powertrain, this car is a joy to drive. I will profer to
            often use Autopilot but then turn it off for fun driving segments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> It’s a beauty</strong> - The car is so pretty. There have
            been so many times that I’ve returned to the car, looked up at it,
            and just been in at the beautiful design. It’s truly a piece of art.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You often get a brand new car!</strong> - People have said
            it’s like Christmas morning when you get a big new update. You see a
            notification of an available update; you get excited; you update the
            vehicle thinking about the new features you’re going to get; the
            update finishes; you rush to explore all the new features; you love
            them (some of them, at least); and you feel like you just got a
            brand new car.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Free fuel</strong> - This is not the case for everyone. Most
            people charge at home and have the benefit of that extreme
            convenience. If you live in an area with a good number of public
            charging stations — and they’re all free. Well, technically, you
            should have to pay for Supercharging at some point, but I make
            enough referrals that I don’t have that issue. Most of Tesla
            charging is done on slow chargers, but they’re all hosted by stores,
            malls, the city, or someone else.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>No gas stations</strong> - This is such an obvious one that
            I almost didn’t think about it, but it’s a truly wonderful thing.
            Gas stations are not exactly known for their beauty, great scent, or
            lounge amenities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Acceleration</strong> - I just gotta say it again. The
            acceleration of the car, even the SR+, is so smooth and powerful
            that it’s a true daily joy. It adds a little thrill to many days.
            Life should be fun.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Infotainment</strong> - From Netflix to Beach Buggy to
            Stardew Valley to YouTube to Caraoke, the infotainment options on
            the Model 3 are wonderful. Also, this is one area where the Model 3
            clearly beats the Model S and Model X. The horizontal screen is just
            much better for the video options.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stays cool under sun</strong> - There’s a “cabin overheat
            protection” feature in the Tesla that makes sure the temperature
            inside the car doesn’t get too hot when you’re away from it. If you
            live in hot climate, you know how quickly your car can turn into a
            giant oven. It’s not fun. Opening the doors and having the heat
            light your hair on fire is not one of the top retirement attractions
            of the Sun Belt. With Tesla’s cabin overheat protection, you never
            have to worry about that. The car does it for you. It provides a
            significant boost to quality of life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Tesla app</strong> - I’m bundling several things in here
            under this “single benefit.” You can easily pre-cool or preheat the
            car, lock or unlock it, honk the horn at someone, turn Sentry Mode
            on or off (Sentry Mode should probably be its own item on this
            list), check the charging status, summon the car (again, this should
            be its own item on the list), ask for roadside assistance, schedule
            Tesla service, upgrade the software, watch the progress of a
            software upgrade, locate the car, and more.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Overall, the car is better, safer, and more fun than any other car
            on the market (except perhaps another Tesla if you prefer a bigger
            vehicle). Tesla haters can hate on me for saying that, but
            seriously, you saw the headline — if you prefer another car, don’t
            open an article with the headline, “10 Best Things About Owning A
            Tesla Model 3.”"
